This course looks at web users from a few different perspectives.  First, we look at identifying techniques to determine web user identities from a server perspective.  Second, we will look at obfuscating techniques from a user whom seeks to be anonymous.  Finally, we look at forensic techniques, which, when given a hard drive or similar media, we identify users who accessed that server.
