This course looks at web users from a few different perspectives.  First, we look at identifying techniques to determine web user identities from a server perspective.  Second, we will look at obfuscating techniques from a user whom seeks to be anonymous.  Forensic techniques have been removed in favor of Zak's other course, foresnic database analysis.
